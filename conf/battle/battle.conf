//   开关选项: 可以用 on/off, yes/no 或 1/0 来表示开关
// 百分比选项: 填写100即表示100%
//   掩码选项: 没有特殊说明的情况下，默认用来表示游戏中各单位的类型
//             1: 玩家, 2: 魔物, 4: 宠物, 8: 生命体, 16:佣兵
//             掩码选项一个数值可以表示里面有多个内容。
//             例如：若您想表示玩家和宠物，那么只需将1和4相加，填写5即可

// 哪些单位能拥有基础攻击值(即baseatk值)
// 或者说，能够让他的str属性，影响到他输出的伤害？(掩码选项)
// 默认值是 9 表示此选项包含：玩家(1) + 生命体(8)
enable_baseatk: 9

// 哪些单位能够完全回避？(掩码选项)
// 默认值是 1 表示此选项包含：玩家(1)
enable_perfect_flee: 1

// 除了玩家和魔物外，其他单位(宠物、生命体、佣兵)产生暴击的倍率 (百分比选项)
critical_rate: 100

// Should normal attacks give you a walk delay? (掩码选项)
// If no, characters can move as soon as they start an attack (attack animation
// or walk animation may be omitted client-side, causing cropped attacks or
// monsters that teleport to you)
// Otherwise, the delay is equal to the 'attack animation' (amotion)
attack_walk_delay: 15

// Move-delay adjustment after being hit. (百分比选项)
// The 'can't walk' delay after being hit is calculated as a percentage of the damage animation duration.
// NOTE: Only affects the normal delay from a single attack, not the delay added by the multihit_delay option below.
pc_damage_walk_delay_rate: 20
damage_walk_delay_rate: 100

// Move-delay adjustment for multi-hitting attacks.
// When hit by a multi-hitting skill like Lord of Vermillion or Jupitel Thunder, characters will be 
// unable to move for an additional "(number of hits -1) * multihit_delay" milliseconds.
// 80 is the setting that feels like Aegis (vs Sonic Blows)
// 230 is the setting that makes walkdelay last until the last hit (vs Jupitel thunder)
multihit_delay: 80

// Damaged delay rate for players (百分比选项)
// (Setting to no/0  will be like always endure)
player_damage_delay_rate: 100

// Should race or element be used to consider someone undead?
// 0 = element undead
// 1 = race undead
// 2 = both (either one works)
undead_detect_type: 0

// Does HP recover if hit by an attribute that's same as your own? (开关选项)
attribute_recover: no

// What is the minimum and maximum hitrate of normal attacks? 
min_hitrate: 5
max_hitrate: 100

// Type of penalty that is applied to FLEE when more than agi_penalty_count monsters are targetting player
// 0 = no penalty is applied
// 1 = agi_penalty_num is reduced from FLEE as a %
// 2 = agi_penalty_num is reduced from FLEE as an exact amount
agi_penalty_type: 1

// When agi penalty is enabled, to whom it should apply to? (掩码选项)
// By default, only players get the penalty.
agi_penalty_target: 1

// Amount of enemies required to be targetting player before FLEE begins to be penalized
agi_penalty_count: 3

// Amount of FLEE penalized per each attacking monster more than agi_penalty_count
agi_penalty_num: 10

// Type of penalty that is applied to both equipment and vit DEF when more than vit_penalty_count monsters are targetting player
// 0 = no penalty is applied
// 1 = vit_penalty_num is reduced from DEF as a %
// 2 = vit_penalty_num is reduced from DEF as an exact amount
vit_penalty_type: 1

// When vit penalty is enabled, to whom it should apply to? (掩码选项)
// By default, only players get the penalty.
vit_penalty_target: 1

// Amount of enemies required to be targetting player before defense begins to be penalized
vit_penalty_count: 3

// Amount of VIT defense penalized per each attacking monster more than vit_penalty_count
vit_penalty_num: 5

// Use alternate method of DEF calculation for physical attacks.
// With 0, disabled (use normal def% reduction with further def2 reduction)
// At 1 or more defense is subtraction of (DEF * value).
// eg: 10 + 50 def becomes 0 + (10*type + 50)
weapon_defense_type: 0

// MDEF, same as above. (MDEF * value)
magic_defense_type: 0

// Change attacker's direction to face opponent on every attack? (掩码选项)
// NOTE: On official servers knockback of some skills like Firewall is always based on the
// last direction walked. Even when attacking in a completely different direction, the
// knockback direction won't change, so e.g. if you walk north and then attack an enemy to
// the south you will still be knocked back to the south by Firewall. Immobile monsters
// will always be knocked back to the south as their default direction is north.
attack_direction_change: 0

// For those who is set, their innate attack element is "not elemental"
// (100% versus on all defense-elements) (掩码选项)
// NOTE: This is the setting that makes it so non-players can hit for full
// damage against Ghost-type targets with normal attacks (eg: vs. Ghostring).
attack_attr_none: 14

// Rate at which equipment can break (base rate before it's modified by any skills)
// 1 = 0.01% chance. Default for official servers: 0
equip_natural_break_rate: 0

// Overall rate of which your own equipment can break. (百分比选项)
// This rate affects penalty breaking rate of skills such as power-thrust and your natural breaking rate 
// (from equip_natural_break_rate). If a Sage's endow skill fails and this is above 0, the selected char's
// weapon will be broken.
equip_self_break_rate: 100

// Overall rate at which you can break target's equipment. (百分比选项)
// This affects the behaviour of skills like acid terror and meltdown
equip_skill_break_rate: 100

// Do weapon attacks have a attack speed delay before actual damage is applied? (开关选项)
// NOTE: The official setting is yes, even thought it degrades performance a bit.
delay_battle_damage: yes

// 使用弓系武器或枪系武器时，是否消耗箭矢或子弹？
// 0 = 不消耗箭矢或子弹
// 1 = 消耗
// 2 = Yes even for skills that do not specify arrow consumption when said 
//     skill is weapon-based and used with ranged weapons (auto-guesses which 
//     skills should consume ammo when it's acquired via a card or plagiarize)
arrow_decrement: 1

// Should the item script bonus 'Autospell' check for range/obstacles before casting?
// Official behavior is "no", setting this to "yes" will make skills use their defined
// range. For example, Sonic Blow requires a 2 cell distance before autocasting is allowed.
// This setting also affects autospellwhenhit.
autospell_check_range: no

// If both the attacker and the target are on the same tile, should the target be knocked back to the left?
// Official behavior is "yes", setting this to "no" will knock the target back behind the attacker.
knockback_left: yes

// 玩家是否能够同时召唤出猎鹰和狼？(开关选项)
