//   开关选项: 可以用 on/off, yes/no 或 1/0 来表示开关
// 百分比选项: 填写100即表示100%
//   掩码选项: 没有特殊说明的情况下, 默认用来表示游戏中各单位的类型
//             1: 玩家, 2: 魔物, 4: 宠物, 8: 生命体, 16:佣兵
//             掩码选项一个数值可以表示里面有多个内容.

// MVP魔物的HP倍率. (百分比选项)
mvp_hp_rate: 100

// 普通魔物的HP倍率 (除了MVP魔物之外的所有魔物, 都算普通魔物) (百分比选项)
monster_hp_rate: 100

// 魔物的攻击速度上限是多少? 
monster_max_aspd: 199

// Defines various mob AI related settings. (掩码选项)
// 0x001: When enabled mobs will update their target cell every few iterations
//        (normally they never update their target cell until they reach it while
//        chasing)
// 0x002: Makes mob use their "rude attack" skill (usually warping away) if they
//        are attacked and they can't attack back regardless of how they were
//        attacked (eg: GrimTooth), otherwise, their rude attack" is only activated
//        if they can't melee reach the target (eg: sniping)
// 0x004: If not set, mobs that can change target only do so when attacked within a
//        distance of [attack range+1], otherwise mobs may change target and chase 
//        ranged attackers. This flag also overrides the 'provoke' target.
// 0x008: When set, mobs scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode
//        to make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a
//        single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)
// 0x010: If set, mob skills defined for friends will also trigger on themselves.
// 0x020: When set, the monster ai is executed for all monsters in maps that 
//        have players on them, instead of only for mobs who are in the vicinity
//        of players.
// 0x040: When set, when the mob's target changes map, the mob will walk towards
//        any npc-warps in it's sight of view (use with mob_warp below)
// 0x080: If not set, mobs on attack state will only change targets when attacked
//        by normal attacks. Set this if you want mobs to also switch targets when
//        hit by skills.
// 0x100: When set, a mob will pick a random skill from it's list and start from
//        that instead of checking skills in orders (when unset, if a mob has too
//        many skills, the ones near the end will rarely get selected)
// 0x200: When set, a mob's skill re-use delay will not be applied to all entries of
//        the same skill, instead, only to that particular entry (eg: Mob has heal
//        on six lines in the mob_skill_db, only the entry that is actually used
//        will receive the delay). This will make monsters harder, especially MvPs.
// 0x400: Set this to make mobs have a range of 9 for all skills. Otherwise, they 
//        will obey the normal skill range rules.
// 0x800: When set, monsters that are provoked will always change target to the
//        provoking person, even if they would usually not change target on attack.
// Example: 0x140 -> Chase players through warps + use skills in random order.
monster_ai: 0

// How often should a monster rethink its chase?
// 0: Every 100ms (MIN_MOBTHINKTIME)
// 1: Every cell moved
// 2: Every 2 cells moved
// 3: Every 3 cells moved (official)
// x: Every x cells moved
// Regardless of this setting, a monster will always rethink its chase if it has 
// reached its target. Increase this value if you want to make monsters continue
// moving after they lost their target (hide, no line of sight, etc.).
monster_chase_refresh: 3

// 魔物是否能够被传送走? (掩码选项)
// 0: 不能 (默认).
// 1: 如果魔物靠近普通传送点的话, 能被传送走(过图)
// 2: 如果魔物走进牧师的“传送之阵”的话, 能被传送走
// 4: 如果目标地图拥有 'nobranch' 地图标记, 则不会被传送.
//

chase_range_rate: 100

// Which level of of Vulture's Eye and Snake's Eye should monsters have learned?

// 
// 0: 不覆盖, 使用召唤脚本写的魔物名称 (都是英文魔物名)
// 1: 总是使用 mob_db 中的 Name 字段进行覆盖 (英文魔物名)
// 2: 总是使用 mob_db 中的 JName 字段进行覆盖 (中文魔物名)
//
// 默认值为: 2

// Set to 0 to disable mob skills.
mob_skill_rate: 100

// Mob skill delay adjust (百分比选项)
// After a mob has casted a skill, there is a delay before being able to

mob_spawn_delay: 100
plant_spawn_delay: 100
boss_spawn_delay: 100

// Should mobs not spawn within the viewing range of players?
// 0 is disabled, otherwise it is the number of retries before giving up 
// and spawning the mob within player-view anyway, unless the max (100) is used,
// in which case the mob will not be spawned, and it'll be retried again in
// 5 seconds.
// NOTE: This has no effect on mobs that always spawn on the very same cell
// (like ant eggs) except if you set it to the max.
no_spawn_on_player: 0

// Should spawn coordinates in the mob-spawn files be ignored? (开关选项)
// If set to yes, all monsters will have a random respawn spot across the whole

// Do summon slaves inherit the passive/aggressive traits of their master?
// 0: No, retain original mode.

//          会自动转成按百分比显示血量. 
//       2、当同时启用选项1、2、8后, 如果魔物的编号加上后超长的话, 那么编号将被截断, 
//          请适当的调整要展示的内容.  
// 提示: rAthenaCN 建议的默认值为 118

// Default: no
mob_size_influence: no

// How should a monster be trapped by an icewall casted directly on it?
// On official servers, monsters can only leave an icewall to the west and south. If their target is north or east of
// them they will continously try to chase it but fail doing so. This brings them into a loop during which they will use
// idle and chase skills. Boss monsters on the other hand will behave like a trapped monster, do not move and will use
// idle and rudeattacked skills (when attacked).
// 0: Monster won't be stuck in icewall at all.
// 1: Monster will behave like a trapped monster.
// 2-255: Number of loops a monster will go through the behavior described above before it frees itself from icewall.
// NOTE: On some servers, normal monsters can free themselves after 15-35 second depending on their speed. On other
// servers, they will be stuck inside icewall until it expires. Also, many official servers (e.g. iRO) have casting
// icewall completely blocked on all maps that have boss monsters on them.
// Default (least exploitable): mob - 75, boss - 0
// Default (most official): mob - 220, boss - 1

// Should a monster respawn and a warning printed to the map server when a monster couldn't move for a long time?
// This can be legit gameplay (e.g. players keeping an MVP stuck inside icewall), but if you want to prevent any
// exploits and be notified about them, you can set this to yes.
monster_stuck_warning: no
